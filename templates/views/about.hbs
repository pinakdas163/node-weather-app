        <p>My name is Pinak Das. I am a software developer and I love to learn new web technologies. This project is built to simply practice Node.js as a server side language. Locationiq API is used to fetch forward geocoding by sending string address from the user and then receiving location cordinates. OpenWeatherMap Api is used to fetch the current weather data using those location cordinates. Finally, HBS templating engine for express.js is used to build the user interface and display the result to the user.</p>
